Temperature control script create for chip. It controls an mcp23017 wich starts a fan via a transistor if the temperature is more than 34°
TODO:
-add script to be executed automatically when the system starts. It has to check the temperature every 2/5 minutes according to user settings.
-the print functions in the python script are for debug only, so they have to be commented or removed
